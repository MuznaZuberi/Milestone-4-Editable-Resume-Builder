# 📝 Editable Resume Builder
## 🎯 Objective
#### This milestone focuses on making the generated resume editable after creation. Users can directly modify resume sections, such as Education, Work Experience, and Skills, and see the changes instantly without page reloading.

## 📋 Features
. Editable Sections: Users can click on individual sections (Education, Work Experience, Skills) and make inline edits.

. Real-time Updates: Changes are reflected immediately without requiring a page refresh, ensuring a seamless experience.

. Form Validation: Ensures that the user input is valid and that mandatory fields are filled in correctly.

## 💡 Key Requirements:

### 1. Editable Sections:
. Implement the ability to click on specific sections (e.g., Personal Information, Education, Work Experience) and make them editable.

. Ensure that the content becomes a text input field that allows the user to modify the data inline.

### 2. Real-time Updates:
  . As soon as changes are made, they should reflect on the resume instantly without reloading the page.

  . Use state management (like React’s estate or any reactive framework) to handle and display updates dynamically.

## 🛠️ Scoring Breakdown:
### 1. Editable Functionality Implementation (60 Points):
. Is each section of the resume editable (i.e., can users click and modify content)?

. Are changes reflected in real time without requiring a page refresh?

### 2. TypeScript Code Quality and Logic (40 Points):
. Is the TypeScript code structured in an organized and efficient manner?

. Does the code ensure type safety and avoid common pitfalls like type assertions and errors?

## 💻 Technologies Used

. TypeScript: Ensuring strong typing and maintainable code.

. React: Managing real-time updates with state and rendering editable components.

. HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the dynamic resume

### 🚀 How It Works:
. Click to Edit: Users can click on the resume sections (e.g., Education, Work Experience) to enter edit mode.

. Real-Time Reflection: Any changes made in the editable fields are reflected in real-time, allowing the user to instantly see the updates.

. Dynamic Interaction: No need for manual saves or page refreshes – everything happens dynamically as users edit content.
